# Windows GUI Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the process of setting up a Google Compute Engine VM in the form of a Windows Server with a GUI. We will be utilizing [the Google Compute Engine Service](https://cloud.google.com/compute) to set up a VM. Additionally, this tutorial will go through setting up a Python development environment with Anaconda and Visual Studio Code.  

- Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and then click this [link](https://cloud.google.com/compute) to jump to the service. 
- Find the "Go to Console" button and click it. It wil bring you to your VM instances page assuming you are signed into your GCP account.
- From the top panel of the instances page, click the "Create Instance" button.
